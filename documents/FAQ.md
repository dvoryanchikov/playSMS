    Answer:

    If you set the SMS footer in your Preferences, then the SMS footer
    will be added to the end of your SMS, this is useful when using
    gateway module with no ability to set SMS sender ID.

    Gateway modules which have the ability to set SMS sender ID will
    set SMS sender ID to the SMS.

    The sender ID is set according to this order:

    1. Default sender ID on Main configuration (in case it exists)
    2. Module sender ID on active gateway configuration (in case it exists)
    3. SMS sender ID on User preferences

    Sender ID is managed from Manage sender ID menu and is required to be 
    approved by administrator.
